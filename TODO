Short term:
	* Add a clean target
	* Refurbish default configuration, GCC configuration and make these more OS
		independent. Probably should add host and target notations too.

Mid term:
	* Better documentation
	* Better tests (probably integrated too)
	* Gem spec
	* Add Visual C++ and Windows SDK support
	* Add Java support with different SDKs
	* Add C# support (MS .Net and Mono)
	* Add Vala support
	* Multithreading support
	* Regular expression support

Long term:
	* Some configuration ability (ala configure scripting, but much more sane)
	* Some installation support (ability to generate deb/rpm/tgz/zip/msi/...
		packages and/or install these on the OS)
	* Web interface (with Sinatra or Rails) to make the system ideal for build server
